Submitting Plugins
==================

OpenGamepadUI maintains a plugin store where users can download and
install community created plugins. This list of plugins is maintained in
the
`OpenGamepadUI-plugins <https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI-plugins>`__
repository.

To have your plugin considered for inclusion in the plugin store, create
a pull request to the plugins repository with an entry for your plugin.

.. warning::
   Please be aware that we do not allow private repositories,
   “black-box” binaries, deliberately obfuscated code or any other items
   that would undermine the ability to verify the functionality of a
   plugin and or any underlying software.
