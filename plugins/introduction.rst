Introduction
============

OpenGamepad UI uses a plugin system to extend functionality.

Installing Plugins
------------------

Plugins can be installed through OpenGamepadUI from the plugin store in
the ``Settings`` menu. The `OpenGamepadUI Plugin
Store <https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI-plugins>`__ provides
community submitted plugins that have been tested and approved.

Plugins can be manually installed by placing the plugin archive in
``~/.local/share/opengamepadui/plugins``.

.. warning::
   Plugins contain arbitrary code, which will be
   executed with the same privileges as OpenGamepadUI itself. An evil
   plugin may contain malware which can take over your computer, and
   destroy or steal your data. Do not install plugins from untrusted
   sources.


Writing Plugins
---------------

The OpenGamepadUI plugin system is inspired by the modding system
implemented by
`Delta-V <https://gitlab.com/Delta-V-Modding/Mods/-/blob/main/game/ModLoader.gd>`__.
It works by taking advantage of Godotâ€™s
`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_projectsettings.html#class-projectsettings-method-load-resource-pack>`__
method, which can allow OpenGamepadUI to load Godot scripts and scenes
from a zip file.

The plugin loader looks for zip files in the ``user://plugins``
directory and parses the ``plugin.json`` file contained inside. If the
plugin metadata is valid, the plugin loader loads the zip file as a
resource pack. This system makes plugins incredibly powerful, and can be
written to modify nearly all aspects of OpenGamepadUI.
