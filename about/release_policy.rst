Release Policy
====================

OpenGamepadUI's release policy is subject to change, but the description below
provides a general idea of what to expect.

OpenGamepadUI versioning
----------------

OpenGamepadUI follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`__ with a
``major.minor.patch`` versioning system, to help provide a relatively stable
platform for plugin developers:

- The ``major`` version is incremented when major compatibility breakages happen
  which imply significant porting work to move plugins from one major version
  to another.

- The ``minor`` version is incremented for feature releases that do not break
  compatibility in a major way. Minor compatibility breakage in very specific
  areas *may* happen in minor versions, but the vast majority of plugins
  should not be affected or require significant porting work.

  In some circumstances a bug fix or feature might effect application behavior,
  but it should be generally backwards compatible.

.. tip::

    Upgrading to a new minor version is recommended for all users,
    but some testing is necessary to ensure that all plugins still behave as
    expected.

- The ``patch`` version is incremented for maintenance releases which focus on
  fixing bugs and security issues, and backporting safe usability enhancements. 
  Patch releases are backwards compatible.

  Patch versions may include minor new features which do not impact the
  existing API, and thus have no risk of impacting existing plugins.

.. tip::

    Updating to new patch versions is therefore considered safe and strongly
    recommended to all users of a given stable branch.

We call ``major.minor`` combinations *stable branches*. Each stable branch
starts with a ``major.minor`` release (without the ``0`` for ``patch``) and is
further developed for maintenance releases in a Git branch of the same name
(for example patch updates for the 1.0 stable branch are developed in the
``1.0`` Git branch).
