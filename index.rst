OpenGamepadUI Docs - *development* branch
==================================

Welcome to the official documentation for OpenGamepadUI, the free and open 
source game launcher and overlay written using `Godot Engine <https://godotengine.org>`__,
designed with a gamepad native experience in mind.

The table of contents in the sidebar should let you easily access the documentation
for your topic of interest. You can also use the search bar in the top-left corner.

OpenGamepadUI is an open source project developed by a community of volunteers.
The documentation team can always use your feedback and help to improve the
tutorials and class reference. If you don't understand something, or cannot find
what you are looking for in the docs, help us make the documentation better
by letting us know!
