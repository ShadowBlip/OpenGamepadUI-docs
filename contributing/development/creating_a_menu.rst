Creating a menu
===============

OpenGamepadUI is composed of many different menus, all of which are contained
in their own scene. Menus are the glue between the various built-in and custom
UI components and the backend systems that we want to control.

This page is a guide on how most menus are created in OpenGamepadUI and how they
work with other menus.

How menu switching works
------------------------

In OpenGamepadUI, nearly all menus get loaded and added to the scene tree on 
startup. Menus are "switched to" by toggling visibility of the menu in the scene 
tree. The visibility of menus is coordinated using a 
:ref:`StateMachine<class_StateMachine>` which keeps track of the current menu
state.

You can see in this example scene tree that there is an instance of every menu
defined in the scene, but their visibility is toggled off:

Each menu toggles their visibility on or off by listening for the ``state_entered``
or ``state_exited`` signals fired by its :ref:`State<class_State>`. This is
normally done using a :ref:`VisibilityManager<class_VisibilityManager>` or 
:ref:`StateWatcher<class_StateWatcher>` node that is added to the menu. These
nodes allow you to configure a :ref:`State<class_State>` to listen for state
change signals to play an animation or show your menu.

How menu focus works
--------------------

Godot has built-in support for focus of menu items. By default, focus will flow
to the next nearest visible focusable UI element. The :ref:`FocusSetter<class_FocusSetter>` 
node can be used to set the current focus in response to a signal.

For more complex focus flows, each element can configure its ``focus_neighbors``
to define focusable nodes above, below, left, and right of the current node.

In some cases, configuring the focus neighbors for each node in a menu can be 
quite laborous. To aid with this, there is also a :ref:`FocusGroup<class_FocusGroup>`
node that can be added to any `Container <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_container.html>`_
node to automatically configure the focus neighbors. :ref:`FocusGroup<class_FocusGroup>`
nodes also have focus neighbors to allow you to jump focus between groups of 
focusable nodes.
