Deploying
=========

If you would like to build and deploy OpenGamepadUI to a remote system, the
``Makefile`` can help make this easier.

First, in the OpenGamepadUI project directory, create a ``settings.mk`` file
with the SSH user and host you want to deploy to:

**settings.mk**

::

   SSH_USER = gamer
   SSH_HOST = 192.168.0.26
   SYSEXT_ID = chimeraos
   SYSEXT_VERSION_ID = 44

Replace the values in this file with the appropriate ones for your remote
device.

You can now build and deploy OpenGamepadUI using one of the following methods:

::

   make deploy-update

::

   make deploy-ext
