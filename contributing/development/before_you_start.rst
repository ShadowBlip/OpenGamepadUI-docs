Before you start
================

OpenGamepadUI is written using the `Godot Game Engine
4 <https://godotengine.org/>`__. If you donâ€™t have any experience with
the Godot engine, it might be best to try completing a tutorial or two
to get familiar with how the engine, and its scripting language
GDScript, works.

There are some great tutorials here to get started:

-  https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html
-  https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/tutorials.html
-  https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/index.html

OpenGamepadUI is primarily written in GDScript and some C++, but parts
of the project could potentially be written using other languages using
GDExtension, if required.
